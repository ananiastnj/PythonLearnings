2. Tuple has negative index. Its begin from -1 at the end of tuple
tup[1:5] - Its a slicing operator. in this 1 is the begining index and 5 is ending of the slicing
Default functions in Tuple :
1. Cmp(tuple1, tuple2) - No longer in Python 3
2. len(tuple) -  Returns the length of the tuple
3. max(tuple) - Returns the max value from the tuple
4. min(tuple) - Returns the min value from the tuple
5. tuple(seq) - Converts the list into a tuple

tup3 = tup1 + tup2 => You can concat 2 tuples in one tuple as third tuple value

'''
tup1 = ("Ant", "Anan", 24, "Apr", 1990)
tup2 = (10,87,56,98,37)
tup3 = "ant" , "anan", "Cat"
tup4 = (50,)
